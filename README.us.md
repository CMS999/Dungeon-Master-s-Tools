## Concept
This project was developed intuitively to test a desktop application for use in *D&D 4e and other RPGs* by *Dungeon Masters*, one that was easy to maintain and expand. To this end, the program has basic functionality for reading *SQL* files from the old *D&D Insiders* service and displaying this data in tables, allowing filtering, searching, and sorting. It also has the ability to load user-created plugins.

## Prerequisites and Resources
The project uses Python 3.10.12, plus two external libraries:
- PySide6, available at ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/))
- Yapsy, available at ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Yapsy/))
